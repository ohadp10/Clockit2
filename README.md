# ClockIt Login

Vite + React app for ClockIt login and signup screens. Currently uses a mock in-browser API so you can run the UI without any backend.

## Run in development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Build for production

```bash
npm run build
```

Backend integration (API Gateway + Lambda + DynamoDB + SES) can be wired later using the endpoints described in the code comments inside `src/components/auth/authApi.jsx`.
